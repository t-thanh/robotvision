This file describes how to install the library "RobotVision". "RobotVision" has in 
general a cross-platform design, but it is only tested on Linux with GCC.

In the following, a detailed install description is given. We assume that RobotVison
is already checked out using the following command:

> svn co https://svn.openslam.org/data/svn/robotvision

First, make sure that CMake is installed:

> sudo apt-get install cmake 

Then, install TooN. Make sure that you install the right version (10 April 2010
version). 

> cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.savannah.nongnu.org:/cvsroot/toon co -D"10 April 2010" TooN
> cd TooN
> ./configure
> sudo make install
> cd ..

For more details about TooN, please refer to: http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~er258/cvd/index.html

Install libCVD. Again, make sure that you install the right version (10 April 2010):

> cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.savannah.nongnu.org:/cvsroot/libcvd co -D"10 April 2010"  libcvd
> cd libcvd
> ./configure
> make
> sudo make install
> cd ..

libCVD might have additional dependencies. For more details how to install 
libCVD, please refer to: http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~er258/cvd/index.html

Afterwards, install OpenCV 2.1.

> wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-unix/2.1/OpenCV-2.1.0.tar.bz2/download
> tar xvf OpenCV-2.1.0.tar.bz2
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
> make
> sudo make install
> cd ../..

The OpenCV dependency is optional. It is only used for visualisation purposes.
To turn it off, set "OPENCV_SUPPORT" to "OFF" in 
"robotvision/trunk/CMakeLists.txt".

Now, download CSparse and copy its source files to RobotVision.

> wget http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/CSparse/CSparse.tar.gz
> tar xvf CSparse.tar.gz
> cp CSparse/Source/* robotvision/trunk/CSparse/
> cp CSparse/Include/cs.h robotvision/trunk/CSparse/

Finally, we can build RobotVision

> cd robotvision/trunk
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
> make 

Now, you can run the demo application:

> ./rss2010_demo 2

For more details, please refer to "README.txt".

If RobotVision should be used as a library, it can also be installed 
system-wide:

> sudo make install
